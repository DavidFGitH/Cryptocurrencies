# Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies with Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview of Project

To help group cryptocurrencies by clustering algorithm using unsupervised machine learning in order to determine the best groups to use and visualize the results.

By using the elbow curve, we can determine that k=4 for our k-means method. Then plotting clusters on the 3D scatter plot gives an idea on how the groups are clustered. Finally we can use the groups that we made to plot the the different cryptocurrencies showing the classes, allowing to identify which ones are ideal for our purposes.
